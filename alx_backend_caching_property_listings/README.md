# Caching Dango 

# Overview

This project implements a Django-based property listing application with Redis caching at multiple levels. The system demonstrates various caching strategies including view-level caching, low-level queryset caching, and proper cache invalidation techniques. The application uses Docker to containerize PostgreSQL for data persistence and Redis for caching, providing a realistic development environment that mirrors production setups.
